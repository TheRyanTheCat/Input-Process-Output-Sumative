/**************************************************************************
Program Name: Volume and Surface Area Calculator for Hollow Spheres
Assignment Name: Input-Process-Output Summative
Instructor: S. Gaffoor
Course Code: ICS3U1-22

Author: Ryan Tan
Version: 1.0

Program Description: Uses a GUI to ask the user about the diameter 
of a sphere, then calculates the volume of air required to fill it,
along with the material required to cover it. Uses another GUI to
show results of the calculations.
